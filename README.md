# EndTech Additions

Mod which adds small features for both the server and the client. Made for EndTech.

# Features
## Dig Objectives
Add 4 new scoreboard criterias: `endtech.dig:endtech.all`, `…picks`, `…shovels`, `…axes`. 
These will count every block mined with these tools, no matter the type. `…all` will count every block mined, no matter the tool!

## Perfect trades highlighter
An easy way to see if a trade is perfect. If it is, it will add a yellow arrow instead of the normal white one. Only supports books
at the moment.
